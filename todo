outgoing calls
- add 1 if legit but missing 1
- do we need a better domestic pattern?

operator queue
- more simultanous callees to deal with callcentric's limit of two
-- a queue or round robin?
-- or just dial with timeout, then try next two?
- better way for an operator to add/remove themselves
- avoid phone off causing immediate pickup and send to voicemail
-- callee must press 1 to connect?
-- caller gets dumped to conference, operators get calls or texts?
