record prompts

remove all the asterisk default stuff

organize incoming numbers:
- VM number goes to VM IVR
- incoming number rings phone (need 1 per phone)
- incoming number is reported as originating number to callee

backups
- daily
- what to backup
-- /opt/asterisk
-- /var/log
-- /etc
-- /home
# figure out <dest> string - ssh connection
# figure out DATE - day of month?
# rm remote/DATE
rsync -avz --delete <src> <dest>/backups/DATE

outgoing calls
- add 1 if legit but missing 1
- do we need a better domestic pattern?

operator queue
- more simultanous callees to deal with callcentric's limit of two
-- a queue or round robin?
-- or just dial with timeout, then try next two?
- better way for an operator to add/remove themselves
- avoid phone off causing immediate pickup and send to voicemail
-- callee must press 1 to connect?
-- caller gets dumped to conference, operators get calls or texts?
