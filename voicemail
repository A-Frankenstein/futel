voicemail strategy:

create 1000 extensions
create voicemail for each with default password
default password: random or something

voicemail.conf:
externpass or externpassnotify
when password is changed, write mailbox number to file
mailboxes in use are those listed in file

provision voicemail:
find next unused mailbox
direct user to that mailbox
send user to password change prompt
force user to change password with externpass?  Or just don't tell them the
existing password, so if they don't change, it's effectively unused

futel phone IVR:
to leave VM, press foo
to access your VM box, press bar
drive user to appropriate VM option

incoming phone IVR:
to leave VM, press foo
