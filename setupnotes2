# set up PAP device
# VERY basic spa-3000(basically any PAP device) setup:
# always login as admin, set view to advanced
# XXX need to add password on the PAP
# make sure DHCP feature is turned off, why why why
primary ntp server north-america.pool.ntp.org
# some spa settings
sip port=5060 # any available, not sure if this needs to be set, can share?
proxy=XXX # domain name of asterisk server
outbound proxy=XXX # same as proxy
use outbound proxy=yes
register=yes
nat mapping enable=yes
userID=666 # example configuration above in sip_callcentric.conf
password=XXX_secret
# some dial strings below:
# straight out, dials extension automatically
# we probably want this - send user to extension 999
S0<:999>
# the default string can be useful for testing
# this has lag
#*xx|[3469]11|0|00|[2-9]xxxxxx|1xxx[2-9]xxxxxxS0|xxxxxxxxxxxx

# now spa-3000 sends user to extension 999 as user 666
# sip.conf says user 666 is the to-callcentric extension
# extensions.conf says what to do when 999 called in the to-callcentric context
