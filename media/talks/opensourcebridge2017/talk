1. intro and overview

what is futel
- free payphones
-- domestic calls
- voicemail
- directories of useful numbers and social service numbers
- directories of interesting numbers
- interactive art
- human operators
- free phone service
-- R2D2
- incoming line
- irc bot

2. motivation

why futel
- quick history overview
- quick origin story overview

3. evaluation

why evaluation
- I can never tell if an idea is stupid
- costs money and time
- needs validation of some kind

how do we know it is successful
- success metrics
- failure metrics

what is success
- usage quantity
- usage quality
-- interaction
- positive feedback
-- interest
-- publicity
- benefit to operators
-- accomplishment
-- skillz
-- creative resume builder
-- notariety, social accomplishment
--- recognition for building something meaningful
--- drinks
--- example, career plan for this could involve dropping out and scamming off the art community
-- seriously, this is not warm fuzzies
--- not going to get rich giving away phone calls
--- must avoid burnout, get contributors

what is failure
- outages
- resource intensive - time, money
- hassle

what are the aspects of the service which are fundamental
- useful
-- wide range of users
cheap to give away
-- gives us freedom - few restrictions
- simple
-- lets us present it to anyone - interface
-- gives us freedom - public devices
- interesting and fun
-- anachronistic
-- unexpected
-- stimulating for operators

4. extrapolation

maybe we can extrapolate this idea
- we can evaluate a project
- we can think about what is valuable in a project
- we can iterate off of that

what is valuable about this
- best lesson for me has been what the constraints give us
-- I feel art is made of constraints
-- lotta constraints when your medium is the payphone
- constraints give us accessibility
-- simple interface is accessible
--- everyone can use a phone (TDD donations sought)
-- rugged hardware is accesible
-- easy connection to large existing network is accessible
--- no apps, no devices, no social networks, no ID

let's riff on this
- what is useful and interesting
- what can we provide
- what is accessible

process
- basic idea or function or desire
-
