Futel Code

The Futel Code shall apply to all interactions with any Futel users, including the initiators and recipients of all calls placed on the Futel network, as well as the senders and receivers of all voicemail used in the Futel netork.

Any action which unnecessarily impinges upon the privacy of any Futel user shall be considered in violation of the Futel Code.  Any action which is unnecessarily disrespectful of any Futel user shall be considered in violation of the Futel Code.

Some examples.

Surveillance of any Futel user is prohibited except as necessary to provide service and ensure the security of Futel and its users, operators, equipment, and host location.

At Futel, we don't believe in protecting our users from themselves; just as the wear and tear of human interaction is evident on the battle-scarred face of the payphone, our service is intended for those who can experience harsh messages. We also, however, do not require that our equipment or operators receive abuse beyond the requirements of administrating the Futel network. Our users may expect respect and assistance regardless of their mental state or social ability. Similarly, our operators may have their own psychological needs which preclude excessive politeness.

Note that nearly every individual who can send or receive telephone calls is a potential Futel user, as are those who happen to walk by our installations.
