Some examples.

At Futel, we don't believe in protecting our users from themselves; just as the wear and tear of human interaction is evident on the battle-scarred face of the payphone, our service is intended for those who can experience harsh messages. We also, however, do not require that our equipment or operators receive abuse beyond the requirements of administrating the Futel network. Our users may expect respect and assistance regardless of their mental state or social ability. Similarly, our operators may have their own psychological needs which preclude excessive politeness.
