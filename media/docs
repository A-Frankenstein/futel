Futel is a combination of a social service and arts organization. We install publicly accessible payphones which provide free telephone calls and  voicemail at all hours. We also provide free phone service to Right To Dream Too, a homeless encampment and advocacy organization in downtown Portland. We also develop interactive audio art pieces which are accessible from our public phones, incoming lines, and occasional gallery installations. Recent funding has come from the Regional Arts and Culture Council and the Precipice Fund.
