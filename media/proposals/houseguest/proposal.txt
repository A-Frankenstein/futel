Houseguest Residency Proposal

Introduction

Street furniture makes public space livable. Some obvious examples are benches, shelters, and decorations, but machines and amenities like water fountains, lights, and kiosks are also part of our urban furniture. Payphones have almost vanished from this landscape as cell phones have become common, and this absence is unfortunate, because payphones offer a unique opportunity for people to interact with their urban environment and with each other.

We propose to bring back this opportunity by installing a bank of five phone booths and two clusters of payphone enclosures on pedestals in Pioneer Square. The payphones in these booths will provide an instrument for interfacing with several interactive audio installations. Some of these will feature live collaboration with remote operators, some will involve algorithmic responses that react to the user and change for future users based on how they are responded to, and some will just be entertaining or informative. While our creative works will delight the curious, the phones will also provide free domestic telephone calls and directories of useful numbers, linking communication, art, and public service.

Description

On picking up a handset, the user will be connected with an operator, who will help them navigate and choose features to experience. Operators can also answer questions and provide conversation at their discretion. During periods of high demand, if an operator is not available, the user will be able to navigate the voice menu unassisted, with the option to select an operator when one becomes available.

Three interactive audio pieces augmented by live human operators will be prominently featured. "Communication Beyond The Veil" will combine live and previous user interactions with digital signal processing and personalized tuning by operators to produce a modern intuitive oracle. In "Auto-Longmont", callers will learn something, if they can only understand themselves. "Line Riff" will turn a conversation into a jam session with an experienced electronic artist. Other options will include algorithmic responsive audio zines, a curated list of external phone-based art pieces, interesting numbers to call, and, of course, free domestic telephone calls at all times.

Operators will perform their parts remotely using cell phones and computers with telecommunications software. Working in shifts, operators will utilize a phone bank system similar to a small scale telethon or pledge drive setup. Chat room back channels will keep operators and maintainers informed about the health of the service and the ways it is being used. Operators will have experience fielding calls from previous and ongoing public telephone installations.

The hardware in Pioneer Square will be rugged payphones and phone booths, which can remain in operation unattended and are armored to withstand public use. All installations can be situated anywhere in Pioneer Square reachable by a protected electric cable.
