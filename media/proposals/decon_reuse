Futel: Yesterday's Payphones, Tomorrow

Futel has provided free public telephone service for several years, and was recognized as Portland's most prolific payphone installer of 2016. We take salvaged payphones, install them in public places, and let anybody use them without charge. Why do we do it? What makes our installations an effective addition to our urban environment? How do the constraints of our materials and services give us flexibility?

Our project reveals several insights on sustainability. An obvious one involves the re-use and continued relevancy of technology which would otherwise be destroyed. Another is in our interface and audience. How can we preserve services and relevance for a range of users, and how can we do this in a sustainable way, without making users rely on fragile applications, personal expense, or continued support from fickle investors? A more nuanced aspect is the sustainability of the project itself. We consider our creative experimentation valuable, but work of this nature will always count many failed attempts among their successes. How do we keep it going without the promise of a large payout for someone? How can we benefit both our users and contributors while still retaining the freedom to tackle projects that more traditional entities won't support?


what is futel
- free payphones
-- domestic calls
-- directories of useful or social service numbers
-- directories of interesting numbers
-- interactive art
-- human operators
- free phone service
-- R2D2
why do we do this
- public service
- preserve phones
- like public hardware
- like urban furniture
- divert junk
- art
-- we feel art is made of constraints
what are the sustainability lessons
- reusing the hardware is easy
-- $500-1000 per installation plus ongoing costs
- best lesson has been what the constraints give us
-- simple interface is accessible
--- everyone can use a phone (TDD donations sought)
-- rugged hardware is accesible
-- easy connection to large existing network is accessible
--- no apps, no devices, no social networks
- what about our sustainability
-- everyone thinks the project is stupid
--- ok, some think it's crazy and interesting
--- but really, it is stupid
--- I put a free payphone in front of my house
-- not going to get rich on providing free calls
-- how can we make it sustainable for us?
--- well, I haven't answered that, others are essential but I do most work
--- ongoing need to find how we are rewarded
---- accomplishment
---- creative resume builder
---- notariety
----- this might not be the best, again, kind of stupid
----- but, there is always the art world
------ even there we are probably viewed as inept hustlers
---- maybe we should get a religious angle?
----- Impinge not thy voice upon the aethyr, for that bandwidth is the LORDs
--- tech accomplishment
---- ops
--- social accomplishment
---- building something meaningful

conclusion
- hard to tell when launching idea where it will go
- need to make, assess, continue
- need to judge success
- need to find a niche
- I say there is still a place for small projects
- I say there is still a place for unrealistic ideas
