I'm Karl Anderson
representing Futel
we install free payphones in public locations
these provide free calls as well as a menu of surprising things to do
including one touch dialing to the mayor
interactive audio art
and live operator assistance
we also provide free phone service to Right To Dream Too on Burnside
in general we are a mix between public service and artistic experience
we have several phones which have been available 24 hours a day throughout 2016
and with this grant we will install several more and develop new interactive features
thank you
