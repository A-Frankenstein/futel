Futel is a 501(c)(3) art and social service organization.

We install public installations which offer domestic calls, messaging, human interaction, connections to services, and interactive audio art.  All services are free of charge. Some features are accessed from free payphones which we install in public places, and some are accessed from an incoming phone number.

Futel is a cross between a public service and a city-spanning art installation. We are inspired by public kiosks, shared experiences, the re-use of discarded technology, and unconventional interactions hidden behind ordinary exteriors. While Futel installations will always provide a valuable and easily usable service, we also appreciate how art is formed by constraints, by roundabout paths or unexpected juxtapositions.

We currently have three public installations, the first of which was installed in 2014. We provide several other free phones to the Village Coalition houseless support organization.
