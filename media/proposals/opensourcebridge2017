description

Futel has provided free public telephone service, telephone-mediated art, and live human interaction for several years, and was recognized as Portland's most prolific payphone installer of 2016. Why do we do it? Is it sustainable?

What similar concepts will be effective in the environment of the near future? How can we expand on these ideas? Which constraints give us the freedom to use our abilities to effect change, or at least confuse people and delay boredom?

Now that we are finally living in the cyberpunk dystopia promised in the 80s, we are poised to seize this moment. We will discuss which aspects of our technology will maximize the influence of our street hardware on the landscape, people and culture of Portland.
