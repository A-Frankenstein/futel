Budget should be the entire budget for the project? The amount of the grant
will be the differences between the expenses and the income? In other words,
come up with a project scope and ask for a grant that covers the missing income?
I'm not sure how the matching funds requirement fits in with that, maybe that
means that the grant must be half or less than the total project expenses?

are we emphasizing the successful ongoing work of the project? Should that be added in the previous experience section?

I think I need these supplementary materials?
- letters for confirmed in-kind donations if any 
- recent publicity materials, if any: Quarter sheet publicity flyer for Curiosity Club presentation by D Wager? Video excerpt of Curiosity Club presentation?
- previous work samples: Quarter sheet publicity flyers for Church of Robotron by Debbie Wager? Two minute video excerpt of me giving atsy/ranty Church of Robotron defense/monologue?
- my resume
- main collaborator resumes: Short bios of Tishbite, D Wager?
