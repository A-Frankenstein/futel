Futel creates publicly accessible installations using payphones and payphone enclosures. Our kiosks are working phones which provide free calls, assistance, and connections to public services. They are also interactive art installations involving algorithmic and live audio experiences.

Our installations include the physical hardware and siting, the ongoing service and upkeep of their interactive, artistic, and telephone functionality, and ongoing creation of content, including audio performances and contributions from Futel artists and public contributors.
