installation notes

We're always into hosting any publicly accessible phone. A phone needs a place to securely mount it, and a phone line going to the box a secure location. The box is small, and needs internet and power. If you want a light on your phone, you'll need to get power to that too. We'll cover the expenses, you help with the installation labor. You can get a free landline in your house if you want.

We have three kinds of phones right now:
