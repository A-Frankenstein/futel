general ops and security tasks

XXX logwatch

* set up backups

external:
eurydice: mkdir /opt/futel/backups /opt/futel/ssh
eurydice: create backup key /opt/futel/ssh/id_rsa id_rsa.pub
eurydice: write scripts/backup-ceres as /etc/cron.daily/backup-ceres

ceres: adduser backup
ceres: usermod -a -G asterisk backup
ceres: add key to backup's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# XXX would be better to make backup's shell rsync or something
# XXX backup user can't see /var/log/messages, /etc, /home

* external: set up monitoring
create a pingdom account at my.pingdom.com
create a pingdom check for futel2.dyndns.org port 42422
# XXX this will probably generate spurious auth logs, maybe just open up a
#     ping port
# XXX this just tells us the box is up, we could publish a http status page for
#     pingdom, or a monitor user with a shell that runs a status command and
#     ssh access, although pingdom can't use that
